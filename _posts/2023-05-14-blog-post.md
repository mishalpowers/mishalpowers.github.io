Final Project Title, Description and Motivation:

Mishal's "Sunflower"!

For my final project, I crocheted a sunflower that lights up and plays "Here Comes the Sun" when the switch is on and the light sensor values
are above a defined minimum. The sunflower is meant to be hung up on a wall. It's purpose is mainly decorative, but it can also serve as an alarm
clock of sorts or a brightness indicator as it would light up and start playing the song at sunrise.

Materials:
- Yellow and brown yarn
- Crochet hook
- Conductive thread
- Arduino
- Light sensor
- Buzzer
- Green LED
- Switch
- Scissors
- Sewing needle

Tips:
- Secure the components with non-conductive thread beforehand so they don't move around
- Account for right side/wrong side differences in the prototype stage
- Be neater and more organized with traces/stitches

Music citation: Here Comes the Sun by the Beatles, written by George Harrison
