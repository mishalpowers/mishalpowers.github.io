For this project, I made three different programs in arduino, each one imitating the flashing patterns of a different firefly. The flashbulb flashes for 0.5 seconds every 4 seconds, the big dipper flashes and increases in brightness every 3 seconds, and the synchronous flashes in a series of 3 every 10 seconds. My tip/trick is to use count, timer and timeOn variables to keep track of the flash patterns.
