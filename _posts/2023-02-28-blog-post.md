For this project, I created a plushy made out of felt with three LED lights controlled by a button and a switch. I prototyped the circuit on paper, then with alligator clips, and then sewed the circuit components into the felt with conductive thread. If I were to do this project again, I would secure the circuit components with non-conductive thread in advance to make the placement more uniform.
