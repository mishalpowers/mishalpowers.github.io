For the Odd Menu assignment, I created a program that determines what menu (regular or secret) a user will pick from based on whether they they input an odd or even number. Once a menu is selected, the user can then pick their meal. My tip/trick is to keep track of indentations and brackets to make the code more organized and user friendly.
