I had to make some changes to my project to fit the requirements. Instead of a pair of earrings, I will crochet a flower that is ~ 10 x 10 inches to hang on my wall. My two inputs are a light sensor and a switch and my outputs are a green LED and a buzzer. When the switch is on and it is light, the LED will turn on and the buzzer will play a song. Photos of paper prototype are attached below.
