For this project, I sewed a circuit into my Sewing Sampler fabric with one LED and two homemade switches, one made of satin-stitched conductive thread and one made from conductive fabric. The LED only lights up when the switches are both connected. If I did this project over again I probably would not have made both of the switches fold to turn on, as this proved to be a bit awkward in practice.
