My name is Mishal Powers, and I am a freshman at Williams College. I am a prospective English and Political Science major. I have a fair amount of sewing experience (both hand and machine sewing), and very little programming experience. I hope to gain a better understanding of the structure of code/websites, since it will definitely be a useful skill to have in the future. A boring fact about me is that I had an everything bagel for breakfast this morning.

Here is a picture of a cow.
