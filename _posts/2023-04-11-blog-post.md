This program determines whether or not there is a "ghost" based on whether the light and temperature values are 
below the thresholds for "cold" and "dark". If it is dark and cold, the red lights in pin 6 and the RGB pin turn on. 
In any other condition, the lights turn off. My tip/trick to play around with the cold and dark values and use print functions
to test whether or not the code is working.
