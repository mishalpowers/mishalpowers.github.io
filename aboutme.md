subtitle: Why I'm in this class!

Have you ever wondered about what the future of technology entails? Wearable tech could be an answer to that question. It combines two of the most vital areas of our lives: electronics and apparel. Wearable tech has been an interest of mine for many years. Though I donâ€™t have much programming experience, I have some experience sewing and making clothes. This class is the perfect opportunity for me to mediate these two interests in a way that is relevant and productive. In the coming months, I hope to hone my sewing and programming skills, while also gaining a better understanding of computers and technology.
